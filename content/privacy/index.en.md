The website operator does not collect any personal data!

Temporary storage of the data is necessary for the course of a website visit to enable delivery of the website. Further storage in log files takes place in order to ensure the functionality of the website and the security of the information technology systems. Our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes.

The data is processed on the basis Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f DS-GVO.



The rights of data subjects and the right to object apply to the collection of personal data. However, this website does not collect any personal data!



Rights of data subjects

You can request information about your personal data that we process in accordance with Art. 15 DS-GVO

You have the right to object for specific reasons.

If the information concerning you is not (or no longer) accurate, you can request rectification in accordance with Art. 16 DS-GVO. If your data is incomplete, you can request that it be completed.

You can request the erasure of your personal data in accordance with Art. 17 DS-GVO.

In accordance with Art. 18 DS-GVO, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority of your choice in accordance with Ar. 77 Abs. 1 DS-GVO.

In the event that the requirements of Art. 20 Abs. 1 DS-GVO  are met, you have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to third parties. The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of log files are absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. They are therefore not based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe a DS-GVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b DS-GVO, but are justified pursuant to Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f DS-GVO. The requirements of Art. 20 Abs. 1 DS-GVO are therefore not met in this respect.

Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 Abs. 1 DS-GVO

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data which is based on Artikel 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f DS-GVO. The controller will then no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of log files are absolutely necessary for the operation of the website.
