Content: Various drawings for the board game Oath

Background: Oath is a board game from 2021 in which completed rounds can be written down in a diary. Or you can draw the adventure. You can find various cool drawings on Reddit. I actually never played the game myself. I drew for a gaming group that told me about their adventures.
