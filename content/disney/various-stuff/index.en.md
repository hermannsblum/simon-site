Date of origin: 2020 â€“ now

Tools: Sketches on paper with pencil, drawing and inking with Procreate on iPad

Content: Various sketches, model sheets for Donald, but also a redrawing of Frank Miller's Scrooge cover

Background: The leftovers category. Everything that doesn't fit anywhere else is presented here. For example, I love the Scrooge cover by Frank Miller. Or rather the idea. However, Mr. Miller's physical limitations prevented a nice drawing. I've also noticed with other covers that good superhero artists can't draw good ducks necessarily. In all modesty, I tried to draw this great cover closer to the Disney style.
