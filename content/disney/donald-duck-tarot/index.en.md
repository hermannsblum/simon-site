Tools: Drawing, inking and colour with Procreate on iPad

Content: A complete Tarot set (Major and Minor Arcana) with Donald and friends!

Background: Black and white gets boring after a while... but coloring isn't really my expertise. So I need something to practice with. Coloring an entire comic page is incredibly time-consuming, so I wanted to use smaller images.

What could be better than Tarot? I'm trying to combine the classic symbolism with iconic designs, stories, and characters from Duckburg. Enjoy the card reading!
