Date of origin: 2023- now

Tools: Concept on paper

Content: Huey, Dewey and Louie set off in search of their parents. The adventure takes them around the world and even further!

Background: I want to draw Donald growing up, so why stop there? The whereabouts of the parents of Huey, Dewey and Louie is also a mystery. There are many clues in comics and series (80 jaar, Ducktales 2017) that I want to link together to form a story.
