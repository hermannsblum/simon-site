Content: Scrooge discovers a bitten coin in the money bin. Together with Donald, he wants to find out the cause and meets an unexpected visitor.

Background: The story was originally written as an unsolicited application to Egmont Ehapa. That's why I squeezed the story into eight pages. With two or three more pages, the story could have been a bit more atmospheric. There is not much room for development in eight pages, so I focused on a simple message. Unfortunately, after an initial positive response from the publisher, there was no more feedback.
