Content: Scrooge is torn out of his everyday life as the richest duck in the world and has to face a competition of galactic dimensions.

Background: This story was developed at the same time as “Monster in the Money Bin” as an alternative eight-pager. I drew them for the fun of it. I also wanted to develop my style. It's a Scrooge story for Donald's 90th birthday. What an unusual idea! I've included lots of references to well-known stories. In addition to the obligatory hints to Carl Barks and Don Rosa, I also refer to a few great Italian stories (Danblane McDuck!). Again, there are only eight pages, so the focus here is on a simple message too. Happy Birthday, Donald!
