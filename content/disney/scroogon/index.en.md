Content: Lovecraft's Dagon story with Donald and Scrooge

Background: Much of Lovecraft's early story is beautifully vaguely described, so that some sentences could be completely taken over in a Disney comic. So the gag is to combine Lovecraft's original text with Disney drawings. Who says the monolith described by Lovecraft doesn't look like a money bin?
