Tools: Concept on paper

Content: One of the biggest secrets is finally revealed: How did Donald grow up? The individual chapters are told from the perspective of a different family member. Multi-perspectivity in a comic about ducks! And while I'm at it, I'm going to reveal the father of Huey, Dewey and Louie too.

Background: Am I megalomaniac? But yes! What the dying Disney fandom desperately needs are canon-defining stories. What opportunities arise. Ludwig Von Drake can can finally be integrated into the family tree. More info about Della! The mood of the story is inspired by books such as “The Catcher in the Rye” (Salinger, see title), “A Member of the Wedding” (McCullers) and “A River runs through it” (Maclean). Alongside “Les Misérables”, this is to be my magnum opus. I am aware that there are already stories with young Donald, but I have higher expectations.
