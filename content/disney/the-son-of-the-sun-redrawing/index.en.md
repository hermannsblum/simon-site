Content: Don Rosa’s Son of the Sun… only more beautiful!

Background: I remember a comment from Don Rosa: he was thinking about redrawing his first story. He wanted to add a page in which Flintheart Glomgold tells Donald and the nephews the reasons for his hatred of Scrooge. The cause was then told in a chapter of “Life and Times”. It's actually a nice idea for Don Rosa's pension, but he doesn't want to draw anymore. So I'm doing that now. I will change the positions of the ducks so that they no longer look like copies of Barks.
