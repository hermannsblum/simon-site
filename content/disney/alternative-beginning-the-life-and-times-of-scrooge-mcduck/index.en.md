Date of origin: 2022- now

Tools: Sketches on paper with pencil, drawing and inking with Procreate on iPad

Content: Based on Don Rosa's sketches, I want to draw the alternative beginning of his epic.

Background: It's probably one of the most popular fan projects, I've seen many versions. In 2022, I drew one page on a trial basis to familiarize myself with Procreate. Now I feel confident enough to draw the full seven pages. I also don't have to worry about the story, text or composition. In addition to my actual work, I can therefore stay in drawing rhythm without much effort.
