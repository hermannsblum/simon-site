Date of origin: 2024- now

Tools: Concept on paper

Content: Donald, Panchito Pistoles and Jose Carioca visit the fourth caballero Miguelito Maracas in Cuba - never used in official films. But he is afraid that the visit will reveal the treasures of Cuba and destroy his beloved paradise.

Background: I read about the fourth Caballero for the first time during a visit to the museum. I was immediately tempted to turn it into a story. It's more or less the sequel to Don Rosa's two Caballero stories. Maybe I can hide the Aracuan bird in the story. As far as I know, there are many stories in Brazil with the Caballeros, even Miguelito Maracas is said to appear in a comic. Unfortunately, I can't read all the stories...
