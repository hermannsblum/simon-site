Tools: Concept on paper, sketches on paper

Content: I'm planning a big epic about Duck Avenger in three parts. 1. The diary of the first Duck Avenger. 2. The second transformation of the second Duck Avenger. 3. The new Duck Avenger.

Background: The first Duck Avenger is very interesting, but Marco Gervasio's characterization of the figures is terrible in my opinion. I'll adopt his characters but I want my first Duck Avenger to be much darker and crazier. The commissioner should not remain a fool. The second part will explain in-universe how Donald-Duck Avenger has transformed from an avenger into a superhero. The third part is about a new character in a Duckburg of the future who slips into the costume. Evronians and One still appear, of course. All in all, it is intended to be an overall analysis of the character Duck Avenger, combining all his forms into a self-contained, coherent narrative. From thief to avenger to hero! And none of them are happy...
