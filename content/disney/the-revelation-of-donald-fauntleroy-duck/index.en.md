Tools: Sketches on paper with pencil, drawing and inking with Procreate on iPad

Content: I can't tell you :)

Background: A new project in collaboration with the German fan magazine Bertel-Express. The basic idea is based on the game of giving a page for the next participant to continue. To set the basis of the story, I wrote and drew the cover and the first five pages. For the whole project, check out the Bertel Express website or their Instagram account:
