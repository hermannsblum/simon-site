Date of origin: 2020- now

Tools: Concept on paper

Content: Magica De Spell steals the lucky dime and Scrooge gets it back. But the story is told backwards.

Background: The next story inspired by Don Rosa (yawn). Don Rosa's best gag stories are the two Magica stories. Donald and Scrooge are restricted by a spell and have to chase Magica all over Duckburg. I'm adding a story, this time the spell causes a story told backwards. How does it work? Let me surprise you! The idea is based on a Simpsons story told backwards, which was probably inspired by other stories told backwards (e.g. the Seinfeld episode “The Betrayal”, which in turn is based on the play by Harold Pinter).
