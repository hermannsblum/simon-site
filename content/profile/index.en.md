Rumpelstiltskin

Big Disney and Ghibli fan. 

Lives where fox and hare say good night.  

He draws in his spare time. Likes to read. 

Role models: Elias Canetti, Boris Pasternak, Victor Hugo, Philip K Dick, Carson McCullers, Hayao Miyazaki, Susumu Katsumata , Taiyo Matsumoto, Don Rosa, Romano Scarpa and others. 

Quite unusual for an amateur duck illustrator, isn't it?
